These are the associations that i got from the class diagram and that i am going to implement.

class Appointment
 static belongsTo = [surgery:Surgery, doctor:Doctor,  patient:Patient]

 class Receptionist
static belongsTo = [surgery:Surgery]

class Nurse
static belongsTo = [surgery:Surgery, doctor:Doctor]

class Doctor
static hasMany = [prescriptions:Prescription, appointments:Appointment, nurses:Nurse]
static belongsTo = [surgery:Surgery, patient:Patient]

class Prescription
static belongsTo = [doctor:Doctor, patient:Patient]

class Surgery 
static hasMany = [doctors:Doctor, receptionists:Receptionist, nurses:Nurse, patients:Patient, appointments:Appointment]

class Patient
static belongsTo = [surgery:Surgery]
